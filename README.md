# VBA-challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to analyize and summarize a large volume data from the stock market over a three year span.

The "Stock Analysis" VBVA script summarizes the raw multi year stock data. It calculates the total volume for each stock ticker symbol and finds the change in points from the opening to the closing for that stock. The results are placed in a summary table to the right of the raw data. 

The "Greatest Values" VBA script takes the summary table created by "Stock Analysis" and finds which stocks had the greatest stock volume, percent increase, and percent decrease for that year.
